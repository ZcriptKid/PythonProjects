# PythonProjects
Most of my Python projects will be put here for documentation and for looking back to, mostly to see how bad I was.
This is just going to be a fun thing. Cheers.

Folders will be created for different stages of Python projects from simple to advanced. Of course it's all relative.
All projects have their own folder to make it easier to navigate.
